This IoT project is aimed to solve the major issue faced all over the world which is the manual seggregation of waste materials from a common waste produced by households.
<br>

<br>
The "WASTE_SEGGREGATOR.ino" file is used to interface one infrared sensors with both IR transmitter and IR Reciever and one Inductive proximity sensor with two Servo motors. 
<br>

<br>
When the waste product is kept ahead of the sensors, if Both Inductive proximity sensor and IR sensor give a positive output, then the servo motor opens the lid of the Trashcan which collects the metal wastes for recycling.
<br>

<br>
If only the IR sensor gives a positive output and the Inductive Proximity sensor doesnot provide any output, this means that the waste product is non-metallic and hence the servo motor opens the lid of the Trashcan which collects the non-metallic wastes for disposal.
<br>

This project can be universally modified and applied according to the various needs. For example when a in a fast food restaurant we can modify the project to test the waste using Capacitive Proximity sensor which tests for Plastic wastes.
